[[test_report_aggregation_plugin]]
= The Test Report Aggregation Plugin

The Test Report Aggregation plugin (plugin id: `test-report-aggregation`) provides tasks and configurations which can be used to aggregate the results of multiple link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html[Test] task invocations (potentially spanning multiple Gradle projects) into a single HTML report.

The plugin adds configurations and artifact views which collect variants exposed by the JVM Test Suite plugin. More details TBD

[[sec:test_report_aggregation_usage]]
== Usage

There are two ways to collect test results across multiple subprojects:

1. From the distribution's project, such as an Android application or WAR subproject -> link:../samples/sample_jvm_multi_project_with_test_aggregation_distribution.html[distribution sample]
2. Using a standalone project to specify subprojects -> link:../samples/sample_jvm_multi_project_with_test_aggregation_standalone.html[standalone sample]

Example 2 could also be used to aggregate results via the root project.

The `test-report-aggregation` resolves specific variants
Details TBD

[[sec:test_report_aggregatin_tasks]]
== Tasks

If the aggregation project applies the `jvm-test-suite` plugin, this plugin adds the following task or each test suite:


`__testSuite__AggregateTestReport` â€” link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.TestReport.html[TestReport]::
